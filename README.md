## What is Font Quiz?
I created this educational quiz to teach about font types and font pairing. Each section teaches a topic and then has a mini-test with instant feedback so the learner can put it into practice right away. There are lots of real font examples and visuals.

## Background on the project:
For my web development class at Utah State University, I was assigned to make an educational web page. I love font design and typography, so this was the topic I chose to create my project around.

## Coding tools I used:
* GitHub
* HTML
  * radio buttons
  * List elements
* JavaScript
  * event listeners
  * alerts
  * Google font APIs
* CSS
 * flex
