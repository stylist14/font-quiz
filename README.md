## What is Font Quiz?
I created this educational quiz to teach about font types and font pairing. Each section teaches a topic and then has a mini-test with instant feedback so the learner can put it into practice right away. There are lots of real font examples and visuals.

## Try it here:

## Background on the project:
For my web development class at Utah State University, I was assigned to make an educational web page. I love font design and typography, so this was the topic I chose to create my project around. I create fonts on the side under the name "Font Stylist" so that's where the logo comes from at the top.

## Coding tools I used:
* GitHub
* HTML
  * radio buttons
  * List elements
* JavaScript
  * event listeners
  * alerts
* CSS
  * flex
  * Google font APIs
